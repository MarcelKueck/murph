# Murph Next.js Project Overview

## Vision

Murph is a platform connecting patients with medical students for accessible medical guidance in Germany. The platform addresses a critical pressure point in the German healthcare system by providing patients with a way to get medical questions answered, medical concepts explained, and determine when professional medical intervention is truly necessary.

## Project Goals for MVP

For this MVP, we aim to:

1. Create a visual representation of the Murph concept
2. Showcase the key user journeys for both patients and medical students
3. Demonstrate the multi-channel communication options
4. Highlight the value propositions through an engaging UI
5. Deploy a working prototype for feedback collection

## Key Features for MVP

1. **Landing Page**: Showcase value proposition with dynamic animations
2. **User Authentication**: Simple login/registration flows for patients and medical students
3. **Patient Dashboard**: Display consultation history and document management
4. **Consultation Request Flow**: Multi-step form to request medical guidance
5. **Medical Student Dashboard**: Show consultation requests and availability management

This MVP will:
- Use hardcoded mock data (no actual backend integration)
- Focus on UI/UX excellence with Apple-like animations
- Implement responsive design for all device types
