# Murph Project Knowledge Base

## Core Project Files

- `project-overview.md`: High-level project description, goals, and vision
- `agent-roles.md`: Each agent's responsibilities and collaboration points
- `technical-specifications.md`: Technical requirements and architecture
- `ui-design-guidelines.md`: Design principles, color schemes, and components
- `content-guidelines.md`: Mock data structure and content requirements
- `development-workflow.md`: Development process and collaboration patterns
- `deployment-guide.md`: Vercel deployment process and feedback collection
- `project-timeline.md`: Detailed timeline with tasks, milestones, and dependencies

## Knowledge Exchange Workflow

1. **GitHub Repository**: All markdown files are maintained in the GitHub repository
2. **Claude Knowledge Base**: GitHub repository is imported into Claude's project knowledge base
3. **Agent Access**: Each agent directly references documents in the knowledge base by name
4. **Automatic Knowledge Updates**: After completing tasks, agents provide updated markdown files
5. **Synchronization**: Updated files are pushed to GitHub and automatically synchronized with Claude's knowledge base
6. **Context Sharing**: All agents access the same knowledge base documents for consistency

## Internationalization Implementation

The internationalization implementation uses next-intl with the following features:

1. **Locale-Based Routing**:
   - Dynamic route segments with the `[locale]` parameter in the app directory
   - German (primary) and English (secondary) language support
   - Default locale set to German
   - Middleware for locale detection and routing

2. **Translation Organization**:
   - Structured JSON files for messages in each language
   - Organized by features and pages for maintainability
   - Support for variables, formatting, and pluralization
   - Direct access through useTranslations hook

3. **API Structure**:
   - Navigation utilities for locale-aware linking
   - Request utilities for server-side locale handling
   - Routing utilities for path generation
   - Middleware for automatic locale detection and redirection

4. **User Interface**:
   - Language switcher component for toggling between languages
   - Locale-aware formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies
   - Consistent text across the application in both languages
