# Murph Project Knowledge Base

## Core Project Files

- `project-overview.md`: High-level project description, goals, and vision
- `agent-roles.md`: Each agent's responsibilities and collaboration points
- `technical-specifications.md`: Technical requirements and architecture
- `ui-design-guidelines.md`: Design principles, color schemes, and components
- `content-guidelines.md`: Mock data structure and content requirements
- `development-workflow.md`: Development process and collaboration patterns
- `deployment-guide.md`: Vercel deployment process and feedback collection
- `project-timeline.md`: Detailed timeline with tasks, milestones, and dependencies

## Knowledge Exchange Workflow

1. **GitHub Repository**: All markdown files are maintained in the GitHub repository
2. **Claude Knowledge Base**: GitHub repository is imported into Claude's project knowledge base
3. **Agent Access**: Each agent directly references documents in the knowledge base by name
4. **Automatic Knowledge Updates**: After completing tasks, agents provide updated markdown files
5. **Synchronization**: Updated files are pushed to GitHub and automatically synchronized with Claude's knowledge base
6. **Context Sharing**: All agents access the same knowledge base documents for consistency

## Current Milestone

**MILESTONE 1: Project Foundation Complete âœ…**

We have successfully completed the project initialization phase. The Project Manager has created a detailed project timeline with specific tasks, dependencies, and milestones. The UI/UX Design Agent has created a comprehensive design system with detailed component guidelines, color palette, typography, spacing system, and animation principles following Apple-like design principles. The Frontend Development Agent has set up the Next.js 15 project structure with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS configuration according to the design system specifications, and created the full folder structure with basic component placeholders.

   - Implemented components including buttons, cards, forms, modals, navigation elements, and feedback collection
   - Ensured accessibility and keyboard navigation support
   - Added special components for communication interfaces (chat, video, audio)
   - Created a test page for verifying component functionality

3. Task 2.3: Internationalization Setup (Content & Localization Agent) ðŸŸ  - In Progress on 2025-03-22
   - Created comprehensive message files for both German and English with structured content organization
   - Restructured app directory to support [locale] routing
   - Implemented internationalization middleware with next-intl v4

## Internationalization Implementation Details

The current internationalization setup uses next-intl version 4.x and has:

1. **Locale-Based Routing**:
   - Using dynamic route segments with the `[locale]` parameter
   - Supporting German and English languages
   - Default set to German

2. **Message Structure**:
   - Comprehensive JSON files with all UI text organized by features and pages
   - Support for variables and pluralization

3. **Current Issues**:
   - The dynamic params handling needs adjustment to work with Next.js 15
   - The next-intl configuration needs to be properly recognized
   - Component-level translation hooks need to be implemented correctly

## Upcoming Tasks

Once the internationalization setup is fully resolved:

1. **Landing Page Design** (UI/UX Design Agent)
   - Design detailed landing page layout
   - Due: Day 12 (Priority: Medium)

2. **Landing Page Implementation** (Frontend Development Agent)
   - Develop responsive landing page with animations
   - Due: Day 14 (Priority: Medium)

3. **Authentication Flows** (Frontend Development Agent)
   - Create simple mock authentication interfaces for patient and medical student login/registration
   - Due: Day 15 (Priority: Medium)
