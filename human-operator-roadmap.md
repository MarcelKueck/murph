## Notes

- After each step, update the GitHub repository with any changes and re-import to Claude's knowledge base if needed
- If an agent's response requires clarification or adjustments, follow up with them before moving to the next step
- You can adjust the timeline based on your actual progress - this is a suggested sequence that can be modified as needed
- To mark a step as complete in most markdown editors (including GitHub), change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Remember to update the progress tracking section as you complete items
